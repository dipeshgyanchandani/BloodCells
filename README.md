# BloodCells
Introduction:
Feature Extraction and Classification of Blood Cells Using Image Processing — Extracted features from 2 channel grayscale images then applied Random Forest Classifier Algorithm to build the model from scratch and classify the Parasitized and Uninfected blood cells using Deep Residual Learning(ResNet) with 87% accuracy.

>>ResNet Algorithm for classification of blood cells :
ResNet Algorithm classifying blood cells into Parasitized and Uninfected. Model is being trained and tested with the total 6  images from test dataset. Model is predicting the class with the 87% accuracy.

>>Feature Extraction from Blood Cell Images and Applied:
